I'm trying to integrate in home assistant mova 600 and mova 1000 started from dreame-mower integration


### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/paolocappellari/mova-mower/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded archive.
3. Copy the `custom_components/mova-mower` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
   - Example: `/config/custom_components/mova-mower`
4. Restart Home Assistant.
